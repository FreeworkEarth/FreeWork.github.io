# Motivation

- Digital Work only in office and artificial light can be exhausting, depressing and very unhealthy
sometimes (I rather work at the beach, in a park, on a rooftop terrace/ mountain or wherever else than my little box or the library)
- Motivation to go or come out of the house (remote worker, home office workers)
- Meet new people/ friends as adult other than colleagues from work
- Explore more places on earth, nature, travel etc. while you can work: EXPLORE EARTH - ANYTIME
- Live healthier (physically and mentally) being more Outdoors, breathing fresh air, getting a nice small breeze, create more vitamin D and 
- get new friends from inside the community
Stuck with a problem 

# Goals/Solution
- The FreeWork App knows your personal schedule, location &  preferences for work (ergonomic / shadowed seating, electricity, close to coffee/ food/ WIFI, toilet etc. and based on weather (rain, wind, humidity) forecast suggests automatically FreeWork days and locations which meet your preferences to you driven through an AI. Also shows already occupied spots and proposes multiple options (also some new and random).
- You can book FreeWork places from people who rent their beautiful yard/property/roof,  WIFI, electricity, seating, etc. like AirBnB for FreeWork places via the App
- FreeWork hubs to enable CoWorking Outdoors -> meet new people/ friends from completely other domains 
- Get help inside the FreeWork community by cross knowledge of other people -> Maybe completely new ideas / companies will be developed / founded


# Usage
This section provides an overview of the current status of the technology associated with the project. It should include screenshots for all implemented screens of the app. Provide descriptive text with each screenshot and build a narrative. (This section will get progressively more detailed with each release of your app.)

CANT DO AS IT BROKE AND CANT BE BUILT RN :( 

# Installation/ Readme. 
This section should provide a link to the repo containing your code, and instructions on how to install and run it. (At this point, itâ€™s basically just download and invoke flutter run. Later, when there is a backend database, these instructions will become more complicated. Some projects may also need people to obtain API keys if you are using third party services such as Google Maps or weather services.) Note that your repo, at this point, should be public.

1. clone repo at https://github.com/FreeWork-earth/FreeWork_mobile_application.git
2. flutter run in your flutter environment
